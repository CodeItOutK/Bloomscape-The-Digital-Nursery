/*
factory: The factory keyword is used to declare a factory constructor. Factory constructors are used to provide alternative ways to create instances of a class.
Category.fromSnapshot: This is the name of the factory constructor. It suggests that it's used to create a Category object from a snapshot.
(Map<String, dynamic> snap): The constructor takes a single argument, which is a Map named snap. This map is expected to contain key-value pairs where keys are
strings and values are dynamic, representing data obtained from a snapshot.
return Category(...);: This line creates and returns a new instance of the Category class using the provided data from the snapshot.
id: snap["id"].toString(),: It extracts the "id" property from the snapshot, converts it to a string, and assigns it to the id property of the Category object.
name: snap["name"],: Similarly, it extracts the "name" property from the snapshot and assigns it to the name property of the Category object.
description: snap["description"],: It does the same for the "description" property.
imageUrl: snap["imageUrl"],: It does the same for the "imageUrl" property.
index: snap["index"],: It does the same for the "index" property.

This factory constructor is useful for converting raw data, often obtained from a database query or API response, into a structured Category object.
It provides a clean and organized way to encapsulate the process of creating instances of the Category class from external data.
